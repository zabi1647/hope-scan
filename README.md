# Hope Scan

## Introduction
Hope Scan is a cutting-edge tool for detecting breast cancer through mammogram images. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, it determines whether a breast is affected by cancer and provides a confidence percentage for its diagnosis. The project integrates a user-friendly frontend with a robust backend and an accurate TensorFlow model.

## Features
- **Breast Cancer Detection:** Analyze mammogram images to detect the presence of breast cancer.
- **Confidence Percentage:** Provides a confidence level for the detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Reliable Backend:** Robust backend developed using Flask.
- **Accurate Model:** Detection model implemented using TensorFlow.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hope-scan.git
    cd hope-scan
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask server:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Upload a mammogram image to get the detection results along with the confidence percentage.

## Dependencies
- **Flask:** Web framework for the backend server.
- **TensorFlow:** Machine learning framework for building and training the detection model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Technologies for creating the frontend interface.

## Configuration
Configuration details for the Flask application can be modified in the `config.py` file. Ensure that the paths to the model and other resources are correctly set.

## Examples
### Example 1: Uploading a Mammogram Image
1. Go to the main page.
2. Click on the "Upload" button and select a mammogram image.
3. Click "Submit" to get the detection results.

### Example 2: Interpreting the Results
- The application will display whether the breast is affected by cancer.
- A confidence percentage will be shown indicating the model's certainty.

## Troubleshooting
- **Server not starting:** Ensure all dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated.
- **Model not loading:** Check the model path in the configuration file.
- **Frontend issues:** Ensure that your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are correctly linked.
